Test your skills: Styling Tables-Task One

In this task we are going to style the same table, but using some good practices for table design as outlined in the external article <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/web-typography-tables/">Web Typography: designing tables to be read not looked at</a>.

There are a number of ways that you can achieve this, but I suggest following similar patterns as used in the tutorial to do the following things.

1. Align headings and data for columns containing numbers right.
2. Align headings and data for columns containing text left.
3. Add a top and bottom border, plus a border above the footer.
4. Stripe every odd row of the main table.
